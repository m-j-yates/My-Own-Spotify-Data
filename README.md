# 🎧 Liked Songs Dataset — Curated by Meg

Welcome to the ultimate genre-tagged music dataset, meticulously crafted by a data-loving curator with a passion for clean formats, deep analysis, and playlist perfection.

## 🚀 What's Inside

This sheet isn't just a list—it's a launchpad for music discovery, genre exploration, and dashboard-ready insights. Here's what I've done:

- ✅ **Cleaned and de-duplicated** hundreds of tracks for consistency and clarity
- 🎯 **Tagged genres** with precision, using modular formatting for easy filtering and clustering
- 🧼 **Removed hidden characters** and formatting glitches that mess with Excel workflows
- 📊 **Prepped for dashboarding**, with genre overlap analysis and playlist clustering in mind I've seperated artists from featuring
- 🧠 **Prepped for Logical Analysis**,column creation for duration, high/low danceability, sub-genre and featuring artists for deeper analysis.


## 💡 Why This Project?
I’m passionate about music discovery and data design. This dashboard is part of a larger initiative to:
- Consolidate genre tags for clustering and visualization
- Map subgenres for deeper insight
- Build modular, Excel-ready formats for future dashboards- Understanding my music taste
- Highlight the different genres to further explore said genres
- Explore historical musical behaviour
- Discovery of any cause and effect; Do I just like it because it's loud?
