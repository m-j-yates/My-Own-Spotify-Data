# 🎧 Liked Songs Dataset — Curated by Meg

Welcome to the ultimate genre-tagged music dataset, meticulously crafted by a data-loving curator with a passion for clean formats, deep analysis, and playlist perfection.

## 🚀 What's Inside

This sheet isn't just a list—it's a launchpad for music discovery, genre exploration, and dashboard-ready insights. Here's what I've done:

- ✅ **Cleaned and de-duplicated** hundreds of tracks for consistency and clarity
- 🎯 **Tagged genres** with precision, using modular formatting for easy filtering and clustering
- 🧼 **Removed hidden characters** and formatting glitches that mess with Excel workflows
- 📊 **Prepped for dashboarding**, with genre overlap analysis and playlist clustering in mind I've seperated artists from featuring and genre further into an additional     subgenre category. 


## 🛠️ Why Am I Looking At This?

This isn't just a spreadsheet—it's a toolkit for:

- Understanding my music taste
- Highlighting the different genres to further explore said genres
- Discovery of any cause and effect; Do I just like it because it's loud?
